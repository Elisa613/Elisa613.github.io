<h1>BTS is my favorite artist.</h1>
<div id="exercise4">
		<p>They are not my first artist that I crazy for, but they will be the last one.Their songs are full of power, and they always know how to warm armys heart.
		I've been crazy for them for 6 years, I actually didn't like them at first because of their group name, but after I understand the meanings of it and all the messages they 
		try to tell the world, I'm really glad that I can enjoy the songs, performances or interviews of theirs.
</p>

<h2>My Favorite song of them is Mikrokosmos.</h2>
<div id="exercise4">
		<p>This is the song from the album 《Map of the Soul: Persona》.Like lots of their songs, this song give me stregth to keep working and not to give up, but the lyrics "SHINE DREAM SMILE" 
		touched me everytime when I listen to this song.It reminds me how they work so hard together, and after years hard work, they finally make their dreams come true, so I can love them right now.

<h3>The concert in Taiwan.</h3>
<div id="exercise4">
		<p>That day must be the best day of my life.I never thought that I can get the chance to enjoy their performance in person, the feelings is unforgettable and totally 
		different from just listening from spotify.I remember they really enjoyed the concert just as army, and one of them even sang a Chinese song to us.Even until now, I 
        still couldn't believe that I've really been their.Hope the world can get better soon, so that I can see them again.		
</p>

<h4>To my biggest love, BTS.</h4>
<div id="exercise4">
		<p>You are the best artist I've ever loved, you changed my life, teach me how to love, and make me happy everyday.
		You are always there when I need comfort, so I will be there for you always and forever.
		Hope we can hold our hands and heading for a better future together.
